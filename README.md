Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science where users design, build, test and maintain software. 
Software Engineering is important is making processess efficient, enable business manage their operations and help to make technology reliable in our day to day lives.
It helps in developing softwares that are reliable and scalable and once that ensure security in our systems. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity- As more complex challenges kept arising there was the need for a shift from just "coding" to a more structured, engineering-based approach, emphasizing the need for processes, methodologies, and discipline.
Mastering Process- As time progressed, the development and widespread adoption of structured programming principles, which promoted modularity and code readability, arose with languages such as C++ and Java arising. 
Mastering Machine- With the evolution of the internet, things like web development and created distributed systems became prevalent. More of cloud computing arose and now the evolution of AI is taking over the world.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.Figuring out what we need
requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. Understanding what the user wants
design - building the framework. Creating the blueprint
coding - converting software design into tangible code.Building the thing
testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches. Checking for mistakes

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Plan everything perfectly, then build it exactly as planned. Examples are like  building a system for a highly regulated industry that requires stable environments
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.

Agile: Build a little, test it, get feedback, and adjust as you go. Examples are like developing a new mobile app, you develop new features as you go and test each time a new feature is out.
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Developers write the software, QA engineers make sure it works well, and Project managers keep everything organized and on time.
1. Software Developer:
Main job: Write the code to build software or apps.
Responsibilities:
-Design and create features or systems.
-Fix bugs and make improvements.
-Test their code to ensure it works as expected.
-Work with other team members to understand what needs to be built.
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
Main job: Make sure the software works correctly.
Responsibilities:
-Test the software to find bugs or issues.
-Create test plans and scenarios to check if everything is working.
-Report problems to developers so they can fix them.
-Ensure the software meets quality standards before it’s released.
3. Project Manager:
Main job: Oversee the project and ensure everything runs smoothly.
Responsibilities:
-Plan the project timeline and set deadlines.
-Make sure everyone knows what they should be working on.
-Communicate with the team and stakeholders (clients, bosses).
-Solve any issues that may come up during the project.
-Ensure the project stays on budget and on track.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
An IDE is a software application that provides everything developers need to write, edit, and test their code, all in one place.

Why they’re important:

-Convenience: They have useful features like code highlighting (making your code easier to read), autocomplete (suggesting code as you type), and debugging tools (helping find and fix mistakes).
-Efficiency: Developers can write code faster and catch errors early with tools like built-in testing and real-time feedback.
-All-in-one: IDEs combine several tools (text editor, compiler, debugger) so developers don’t have to switch between different programs.
Examples:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A popular, lightweight IDE with many useful extensions.
IntelliJ IDEA: Often used for Java development with powerful features for large projects.
PyCharm: An IDE specifically designed for Python development.
2. Version Control Systems (VCS):
A VCS is a tool that helps teams keep track of changes to their code over time, like a time machine for your project.

Why they’re important:

-Tracking changes: Every change made to the code is saved, so developers can see who changed what, when, and why.
-Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work. They can work on different parts of the project at the same time.
-Undo mistakes: If a mistake happens, VCS allows developers to go back to an earlier version of the code and fix things without losing progress.
Examples:

Git: The most widely used VCS. It helps track changes locally and works with platforms like GitHub or GitLab for team collaboration.
Subversion (SVN): Another VCS, often used by organizations to manage large codebases.
Mercurial: A VCS that also manages code changes but is less common than Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
