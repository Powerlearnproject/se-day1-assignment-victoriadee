Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science where users design, build, test and maintain software. 
Software Engineering is important is making processess efficient, enable business manage their operations and help to make technology reliable in our day to day lives.
It helps in developing softwares that are reliable and scalable and once that ensure security in our systems. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity- As more complex challenges kept arising there was the need for a shift from just "coding" to a more structured, engineering-based approach, emphasizing the need for processes, methodologies, and discipline.
Mastering Process- As time progressed, the development and widespread adoption of structured programming principles, which promoted modularity and code readability, arose with languages such as C++ and Java arising. 
Mastering Machine- With the evolution of the internet, things like web development and created distributed systems became prevalent. More of cloud computing arose and now the evolution of AI is taking over the world.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.Figuring out what we need
requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. Understanding what the user wants
design - building the framework. Creating the blueprint
coding - converting software design into tangible code.Building the thing
testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches. Checking for mistakes

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Plan everything perfectly, then build it exactly as planned. Examples are like  building a system for a highly regulated industry that requires stable environments
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.

Agile: Build a little, test it, get feedback, and adjust as you go. Examples are like developing a new mobile app, you develop new features as you go and test each time a new feature is out.
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
